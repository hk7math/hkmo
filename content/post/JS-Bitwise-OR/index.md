The following is my solution regarding a CodeSignal Problem [addTwoDigits](https://app.codesignal.com/challenge/BRW53NHcPd238GxxB)

1st Draft (61 Chars) makes use of reduce
'''javascript
addTwoDigits=n=>
  (""+n).split("").reduce((x,y)=>
    x+Number(y)
  ,0)
'''

2nd Draft (49 Chars) deploys a recursive skill
'''javascript
f = addTwoDigits = n => n<10 
  ? n
  : n%10 + f(Math.floor(n/10))
'''

It turns out I ignored the constraints that the number has only 2 digits... but I learnt a new trick from the best solutionsss
'''javascript
addTwoDigits = n => n%10 + n/10|0
'''

After some [researches](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/654057/where-would-i-use-a-bitwise-operator-in-javascript), there are quite some magical uses for the | bitwise operator, e.g. x|0 can function as:
1. Math.floor(x) for postive x
2. parseInt(x) for string x
3. 0 for many special x (NaN, Infinity, null, undefined, [], {} ...)
